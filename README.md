# Project Overview
This project involves the implementation of an image classification application using Amazon Web Services (AWS) as an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provider. The application allows users to upload images to be classified and returned predicted outputs using a pre-trained image classification model through the AWS resources. 

# Directory Structure
- `docs`: contains the final documentation of the project.
- `ppt`: contains all the presentation files, including the final presentation.
- `source`: contains the project source code.

# Metrics Evaluation
In order to evaluate the performance of the system, we measured the response time and boot time for entire processing of the system and booting time of EC2 instance.
- We encountered memory errors and looping occurred while uploading large number of bigger (size) images. 
- An investigation is needed to determine the maximum number of images that can be uploaded at a time.

Overall, the project successfully demonstrated the implementation of an image classification application using AWS and provided insights into the architecture and infrastructure needed for such applications.
